# ML to predict indicator importance so i can put into my ge

- average the importance over all current features/indicators and see which is best 
    - simple py file, but first get the mse and r2 for each in order to make sure we are only loooking at models that did welll in order to find their best features. 


10.23- below are a bunch of indis that may be interesting to look inot based on our models... but i am now rerunning the ML looper that will now allow to see the r2 and mse as well... so tomororw or today when reading, go thorugh all the output again.
